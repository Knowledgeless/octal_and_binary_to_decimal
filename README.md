# Octal_And_Binary_To_Decimal
.
I have tried to convert octal and binary bases into decimal base. For hexadecimal base it may work with some cases and it may not work with some cases. If you can fix this, then ok. Let me know. I am also trying to fix that. 
.
To get expected output follow the instructions below. 
- Firstly input contains the number of cases.
- After that input contains the number you want to convert into decimal.
- At last input contain the basee (not the decimal base 10)
